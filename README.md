# astro
This is a Python implimentation of a few algorithms that Jean Meeus published in his book "Astronomical Formulae for Calculators". A copy can still be found or Amazon.

# other projects like this
As of now, there are four GitHub pages of projects implementing Jean Meeus' algorithms, written in C, C#, C++, JavaScript, Go and other languages. They all seem to implement a different book, "Astronomical Algorithms" by the same author.
There are two projects in Python besides this one:
o https://github.com/roshbaby/astronomy
o https://github.com/mbset/Astronomical_Algorithms
